# **Who am I?**
### A brief biography ###
<p>ðŸ‘‹ My name is Matheus Hencklein Ponte. I'm a computer engineering student from Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I was born and raised in Leme, a small city in the same state. A passionate about computers, programming, technology, innovation and games. Always curious, I've wanted to work in technology areas since I was just a child. I've been pursuing this dream ever since!
